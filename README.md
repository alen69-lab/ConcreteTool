MATLAB program for reinforced concrete section design
The program can calculate the neccesary longitudinal and shear beam reinforcment for bending, shear and torsional loads.

The program requires at least MATLAB R2014b, as well as polyxpoly from Mapping Toolbox 
(http://www.mathworks.com/help/map/ref/polyxpoly.html)

If you don't have Mapping Toolbox installed, you can use this:
